# Erebus Chatbot (Python)

This Python script implements an interactive chatbot named Erebus. Erebus can engage in conversation with users, answer questions, perform calculations, fetch information from Wikipedia, and more.

## Features

- **Greetings**: Erebus responds to greetings such as "hi," "hello," or "hey."
- **Time**: You can ask Erebus about the current time by typing "time" or "current time."
- **Calculations**: Erebus can perform calculations. For example, you can type "calculate 2 + 2" to get the result.
- **Wikipedia**: Erebus can fetch information from Wikipedia. Type "tell me about Python" to learn about the Python programming language.
- **Small Talk**: Erebus engages in small talk and can continue the conversation based on user input.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries are required to run the chatbot:

- **re**: Regular expression operations.
- **random**: Generating random numbers and selecting random responses.
- **datetime**: Working with dates and times.
- **wikipedia**: Fetching information from Wikipedia.
- **wolframalpha**: Accessing the WolframAlpha API for calculations.
