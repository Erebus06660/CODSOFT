# Face Detection with Screen Recording (Python)

This Python script implements face detection using the OpenCV library and records the screen while detecting faces.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Detect faces in real-time using the screen recording.
- **Screen Recording**: Record the screen while detecting faces.
- **Bounding Box Visualization**: Visualize bounding boxes around detected faces.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the script:

- **numpy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- **opencv-python**: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
- **pyautogui**: A cross-platform GUI automation Python module for human beings.

## Code Structure

- `Face Detection AI.py`: Contains the main script implementing face detection and screen recording.
  
## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    pip opencv-python
    pip pyautogui
    ```

2. Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
   Face Detection AI.py
    ```

3. Press 'q' to stop the script and exit.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to the developers of OpenCV, numpy, and pyautogui for their contributions to the open-source community.
